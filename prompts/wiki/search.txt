Use whenever the user asks about an Old School RuneScape topic, or if the agent needs to gain further context on a topic to improve a response. Always defer to using the information from the wiki instead of potentially-outdated training data.

This tool performs a search for Old School RuneScape topics on the OSRS Wiki. The search will find pages that match or partially match the search term, returning up to the specified limit of results (default: 10). Results include the page title and relevance score for each match, with exact matches prioritized over partial matches.

Examples of searches:
1. Search for information about a specific item: query "Abyssal whip" returns pages related to the Abyssal whip weapon
2. Search for quest information: query "Dragon Slayer" returns pages about the Dragon Slayer quest and related content  
3. Search for skill guides: query "Fishing" returns Fishing skill page and related fishing content
4. Search for boss strategies: query "Zulrah" returns Zulrah boss page and related guides
5. Search for game mechanics: query "Combat triangle" returns pages explaining the combat system and its mechanics

Common use cases include finding quest requirements, locating minigame guides, understanding training methods, looking up item stats, learning about game mechanics, and researching monster drops and strategies.

After receiving search results, if you need more detailed information about a specific page, use the get_osrs_wiki_page_summary tool. If the summary isn't sufficient, use other specialized tools like get_osrs_wiki_page_info_key for specific item or monster stats, get_osrs_wiki_page_tables for structured data, or get_osrs_wiki_page_full_content only as a last resort when other tools don't provide enough information.
